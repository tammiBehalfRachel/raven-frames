    <strong>3rd Party Links</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    This website may include links to third-party websites. Clicking on those
    links or enabling those connections may allow third-parties to collect or
    share data about you - I do not control these third websites and are not
    responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave my website, I
    encourage you to read their individual privacy notes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u></u></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What data do I collect?</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    To enable me to conduct my business operations as well as facilitate
    logistics and carry out accounting processes, I will, when necessary,
    collect, use, store and transfer personal information which may include:
</p>
<p>
    Identity Data: First Name, Last Name
</p>
<p>
    Contact Data: Billing address, Delivery address, Email address, Telephone
    numbers
</p>

<p>
    <strong>How I collect your data:</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    I will collect your Data from you directly in the following ways:
</p>
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="fs-5 mx-5">When you purchase goods or services from me at the studio or by phone.</li>
    <li class="fs-5 mx-5">When you request a quote or estimate or information for a project via email, social media or phone.</li>
</ul>


<p>
    <strong>Failure to provide personal data</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    If I need to collect your personal data under the terms of a contract I
    have with you and you fail to provide that data when requested, I may not
    be able to perform the contract I have or am trying to enter into with you.
    For example to provide you with goods and services. In this case I may have
    to cancel delivery of a product or service you may have requested from me -
    but I will notify you in this case.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How I use your data (The lawful basis for the processing)</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Performance of contract</em>
    <u></u>
</p>
<p>
    In store / by email / by social media / by phone.
</p>
<p>
    This means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance
    of a contract to which you are a party, or to take steps at your request
    before entering into such a contract. For example, to communicate with you,
    to facilitate logistics and to provide payment to or to receive payment
    from you.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Legitimate interest</em>
    <u></u>
</p>
<p>
    Via my website - To monitor and improve the quality of my website platform.
</p>
<p>
    This means the interest of my business in conducting and managing my
    business to enable me to give you the best possible service / product and
    the most secure experience. I make sure I consider and balance any
    potential impact on you and your rights before I process your personal data
    for my legitimate interest. I will not use your personal data for
    activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless
    we have your consent or are otherwise permitted to by law)
</p>
<p>
    I would also use your data when you have given me your consent. This means
    you have opted to receive emails by contacting me directly with an enquiry.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Cookies</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    My website does not use cookies so there is no requirement for you to consent for any actions involving cookies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Who I share your data with</strong>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    I may be required to provide your Personal Data to a third party who is
    classed as Data Processor. This is an entity that is required to process
    some or all of your Personal Data in order for us to be able to provide our
    services. These include:
</p>
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="fs-5 mx-5">Internal third parties, such as contractors or freelances engaged by me to enable me to complete work upon a project.</li>
    <li class="fs-5 mx-5">Professional advisers acting as processors, including my accountant.</li>
    <li class="fs-5 mx-5">HM revenue and customs, regulators and other authorities acting as processors based in the UK who may require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.</li>
    <li class="fs-5 mx-5">Business tools that I might use to run my business in which case they act as the Data controller (listed in the next section)</li>
</ul>


<p>
    While the information you provide may be disclosed to these companies, it
    will only be used for the provision and administration of the service
    provided and will not be used for any other purpose. We will never share
    your information for any direct marketing of additional services, products
    etc.
</p>
<p>
    If we provide information to a third party, we will require it and any of
    its agents and/or suppliers to take all steps reasonably necessary to
    ensure that your data is treated securely and by this Privacy Statement and
    the DPA 2018.
</p>
<p>
    We may of course be obliged by law to pass on your information to the
    police or other law enforcement body.

    with us on your behalf.

        possible, to transmit that data directly to another data controller, (known
        as the right to data portability), where applicable i.e. where my

        contract with you or where I process your data by automated means.</li>
    <li class="fs-5 mx-5">The right, where there is a dispute in relation to the accuracy or

directly via    <a href="mailto:hello@ravenframes.co.uk">hello@ravenframes.co.uk</a>
</p>
<p>
    No fee required – with some exceptions
</p>
<p>
    You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise
    any of the other rights). However, I may charge a reasonable admin fee if
    your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively,
    I may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What I may need from you</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I may need to request specific information from you to help me confirm your
    identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise
    any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that
    personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive
    it. I may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation
    to your request to speed up my response to you.
</p>
<p>
   <strong> Time limit to respond</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I will try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
    Occasionally it may take me longer than a month if your request is
    particularly complex or you have made a number of requests of me. In this
    case, I will notify you and keep you updated on my progress.
